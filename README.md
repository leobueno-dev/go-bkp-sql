Client for sql databases backup in go



A small project to solve a big problem of automating the backup of an MSSQL SERVER database, in a more practical way than using the resources of SQL Server Studio.



> At this moment I have only implemented the SQL Server backup, but I am already preparing the commands for Postgress and MySQL for future implementation.

### TO RUN

#### MSSQL

```shell
task run -- bkp mssql
```

#### POSTGRES

```shell
task run -- bkp postgres
```

#### MYSQL

```shell
task run -- bkp mysql
```
